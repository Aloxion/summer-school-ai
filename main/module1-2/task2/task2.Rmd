# --- Task 2 ---
### Discuss the results

---

#### **Question 1:**

> When looking at the overall results for both tests (using PSA cutoff of 20 or 100 ng/ml), what can you conclude when comparing the results obtained for sensitivity and specificity?

* **PSA ≥ 20 ng/ml:**

  * Sensitivity: **High (≈ 0.60)** — Good at detecting actual metastasis.
  * Specificity: **Lower (≈ 0.67)** — Some false positives.

* **PSA ≥ 100 ng/ml:**

  * Sensitivity: **Low (≈ 0.33)** — Misses many metastasis cases (high false negatives).
  * Specificity: **High (≈ 0.87)** — Very few false positives.

**Conclusion:**

* There's a trade-off:

  * PSA ≥ 20 is better for **ruling out metastasis** (good sensitivity).
  * PSA ≥ 100 is better for **confirming metastasis** (good specificity).
* PSA ≥ 20 cutoff is **more inclusive**, catching more metastatic cases (but with more false alarms).
* PSA ≥ 100 cutoff is **more conservative**, catching only the most severe (but missing many).

#### **Question 2:**

> At the moment, what would you say is the best cutoff to predict PC-related metastasis (20 or 100 ng/ml)? What would be the advantages for the healthcare system when using each of the tests?

* **Best cutoff for early detection**: **PSA ≥ 20 ng/ml**

  * Captures more cases → avoids undertreatment.
  * Useful in early-stage decision-making and triaging.
  * Advantage: **Reduces risk of missing metastasis** → earlier interventions.

* **Best cutoff for minimizing unnecessary follow-ups**: **PSA ≥ 100 ng/ml**

  * More confident diagnosis → useful when deciding on aggressive treatment.
  * Advantage: **Avoids overtreatment**, fewer imaging scans.
