    "# Experimentation 4: Analysing the Frequency Content using the Fourier Transfrom\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the use of the Fourier transform to determine the frequency content of a signal.\n",
    "We will also reconstruct the signal from these frequencies to get a feeling for how the Fourier transform works.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there on, we will explore the spectrum of a time series over time, i.e., we will be able to investigate changes in the frequency composition of a signal.\n",
    "And we will see how we split a signal into a combination of different frequency ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do?\n",
    "- Investigate the frequency content of \n",
    "  * A rectangular pulse\n",
    "  * A periodic sine/cosine\n",
    "  * A non-periodic sine/cosine\n",
    "  * An isolated sine pulse\n",
    "- Reconstruction of a signal\n",
    "- Partial reconstruction of a signal by omission of frequency content\n",
    "- Looking at the spectrum of known signals\n",
    "  * White noise\n",
    "  * A andom walk\n",
    "  * One EEG channel\n",
    "- Looking at how the frequency content changes during the duration of a signal\n",
    "- Extracting the frequency contents of frequency invals, so called (sub-) band spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "- How does the shape of the signal pass on to the spectrum?\n",
    "- Shouldn't sine or cosine signals always just have one frequency?\n",
    "- What can you observe from the partial reconstruction of the signal?\n",
    "- How does the parital reconstruction relate to analysing the spectra of sub-bands?\n",
    "- Which advantage do you expect from taking the spectrum into account when analysing EEG?"
